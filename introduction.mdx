  </Card>
  <Card title="Accurate Color Detection" icon="crosshairs">
    The color detection is enhanced by preprocessing the images to ensure high accuracy. This involves converting images to the HSV color space and applying masks to detect specific color ranges. This process ensures that colors like purple and yellow are detected with high precision.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Web-Based User Interface" icon="browsers">
    The configuration of the Eternity Triggerbot can be managed through a web-based interface.

  <Card title="Weapon Profiles" icon="gun">
    Users can switch between different profiles tailored to different weapons in the game. Each profile can have different settings for parameters such as click delay and color sensitivity, making it easy to adapt to different in-game situations.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Security and Privacy" icon="file-shield">
    Each user has a unique version of the program with different signatures and code structures, reducing the risk of detection by anti-cheat systems. The program uses unique keys and HWID checks for each user, ensuring a high level of security.
  </Card>
  <Card title="External Operation" icon="gear-code">
    The Triggerbot operates externally and doesn't directly interact with the game memory or use mouse events, which significantly reduces the risk of detection and banning. It uses screen capture and color detection techniques that are safe and effective.
